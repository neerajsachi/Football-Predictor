## 📊 Dataset

- **12,000+** historical matches
- **356,000+** player appearances
- **1,000+** clubs from top European leagues
- Features: goals, xGoals, shots, win rates, team form

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Train the ML model:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will:
- Load 12,000+ matches from dataset
- Train 4 ML models (RandomForest + GradientBoosting)
- Save trained model to `models/match_model.pkl`
- Display accuracy metrics

5. Start the API server:
```bash
python app.py
```
Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## 📖 Usage

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Match Predictor Tab:**
   - Enter home team (e.g., "Barcelona")
   - Enter away team (e.g., "Real Madrid")
   - Click "Predict Match"
   - View predicted score, winner, probabilities, and stats
3. **Transfer Predictor Tab:**
   - Enter club name (e.g., "Manchester United")
   - Click "Predict Transfers"
   - View predicted incoming and outgoing transfers

## 🤖 How It Works

### Match Prediction

1. **Data Collection**: Analyzes last 10 games for each team
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creates 14 features including:
   - Goals average (home/away)
   - Conceded average
   - Win rates (overall/home/away)
   - Attack/defense ratios
   - Form differences
3. **ML Models**: Ensemble of 4 models:
   - RandomForest Classifier (winner)
   - GradientBoosting Classifier (winner)
   - GradientBoosting Regressor (home goals)
   - GradientBoosting Regressor (away goals)
4. **Quality Adjustment**: Boosts stronger team's probability when playing away
5. **Output**: Winner, score, probabilities, top scorers

### Transfer Prediction

1. **Transfers Out**: Analyzes current squad based on:
   - Age (>32 = higher chance)
   - Contract expiry (<1 year = 50% chance)
   - Market value (high value = more interest)
2. **Destination Prediction**: Matches player quality to club prestige
3. **Transfers In**: Searches for players by position and market value
4. **Rivalry Rules**: Prevents transfers between rival clubs

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Result Accuracy**: ~65-70% (Win/Draw/Loss)
- **Score Accuracy**: ~20-25% (Exact score)
- **Average Goal Error**: ~0.8 goals

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Predictions based on recent form (last 10 games only)
- Doesn't account for injuries, suspensions, or tactics
- Transfer predictions include random elements
- Home advantage may still be overweighted in some cases
- Dataset limited to European leagues

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add player injury data
- [ ] Include head-to-head history
- [ ] Real-time odds comparison
- [ ] Historical prediction accuracy tracking
- [ ] More leagues and competitions
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] User accounts and prediction history
